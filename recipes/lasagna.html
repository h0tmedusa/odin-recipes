    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="/akuma/odin-links-and-images/images/lasagna2.jpg" alt="cheesy lasagna">
    
    <p>This is one of the world's finest lasagna. Lasagna is a pasta dish which is very simple to make 
        yet is certainly considered one of the best pastas out there. This Italian dish is a global meal
        loved by millions across the planet.
    </p>

        Making lasagna can be time consuming sometimes, but the results are <em>well</em> worth the wait.
        Altough the recipe is incredibly customisable, here is a recipe given by John. Some meat, usually beef
        or sausage does the job. An onion and two cloves of garlic cooked with the meat adds a whole lot of 
        flavor. To the mix, adding a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato cans and 2 cans of tomato 
        paste can really bring that tangyness. As for sugar you will need two tablespoons of white sugar to
        add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavour of the sauce. Some seasoning with fresh parslet, dreid basil
        leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds and black pepper.

        Finally to this mix add the Lasagna noodles. You can use both canned noodles or homemade lasagna. 
        Some parmesan cheese, some mozzarella and ricotta cheese make the lasgana extra decadent. An egg helps
        bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna. That's it! That is all you need to get started
        to treat yourself with a wonderful plate of lasagna noodles.
